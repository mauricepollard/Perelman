                                                <p>Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the
                                                    United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse
                                                    (NIDA), an
                                                    estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of
                                                    which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system
                                                    depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse
                                                    and
                                                    abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction
                                                    and
                                                    overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national
                                                    attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national
                                                    emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse,
                                                    surveillance
                                                    programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous
                                                    shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of
                                                    distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better
                                                    characterize
                                                    the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel
                                                    monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize
                                                    social
                                                    media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM
                                                    abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach
                                                    is a
                                                    machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating
                                                    user
                                                    posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into
                                                    multiple
                                                    groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect
                                                    longitudinal
                                                    data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available
                                                    posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic
                                                    feature,
                                                    when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving
                                                    hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates
                                                    from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs.
                                                    Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the
                                                    mechanism
                                                    by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies
                                                    targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods..</p>

                                                    studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches.
